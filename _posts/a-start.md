This is the start of a journey into Front-End dev using React/NextJS.   I started with Angular 1.x, then 4.x, then React, and now Next.js.  All efforts before now petered out as I did not have a focussed goal, or set ones too large.  This blog will serve as my lessons learned but will, itself evolve into something as I build on it until the next project.

## Markdown convenience

This blog is really nice in that I can just type in markdown and have it show up.    
Pretty low maintenance...

## So...
[This is founded on an example found here on nextjs github page.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter)

From there, I'm ***just*** adding some markdown for this blog entry.    
In my next entry, I'll set up AWS S3 as my content provider fronted by cloudfront with a nice cert to finish this off.  After that, I'll want to setup a CICD pipeline so all updates auto-push out...

## TODO NEXT

Clean up footer.    
Setup S3 and cloudfront     
Detail generic project setup steps with tailwind (kinda personal notes.)    
[Read Markdown blog here](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown)  and get lists and links working.
