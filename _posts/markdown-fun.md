Okay, it is clear that remark is not going to support tables easily and that bulletted lists are a pain a the moment...   
to get it to work, I'd have to use this, [https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) but, ... meh.. too much work

# title
a list
* bullet 1
* bullet 2
* bullet 3

a table    
| head 1 | head 2   
|________|________|     
|val 1| val 2|    
|val3 |val4|
